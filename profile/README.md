# JUA
On a mission to democratise access to knowledge and skills
The story of JUA began with a deep desire to address the unemployment crisis in South Africa. As we delved deeper into the issue, we discovered a fundamental truth—a simpler issue lay at its core. It wasn't just about the lack of jobs; it was about people not earning an income. The prevailing belief that employment is the sole means of income had limited our perspective. We realised that income can be earned by providing a service directly, not just through traditional employment. 

Inspired by this realisation, we embarked on a mission to create a platform that would enable individuals to exchange money for knowledge, empowering them to provide their services independently. JUA was born out of the vision to build a table for knowledge exchange, revolutionising the way people earn an income by sharing their expertise and insights.
